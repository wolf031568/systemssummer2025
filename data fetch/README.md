This is the data fetch project that fetches bitcoin price, ethereum price, and S&P 500 price in real time. 
It updates every 10 seconds to check the pricing and stores it in a txt file for confirmation and history analysis.
Used CoinGecko's api endpoints for bitcoin and ethereum price fetches. 
Had an issue with finding a stable S&P 500 api endpoint.
